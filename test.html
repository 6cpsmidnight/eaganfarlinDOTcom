    <div id="about-me">

        <p class="about-me about-me-left">Hello, welcome to my website, I am mainly a front-end web developer. I started
            coding, although it was block coding, nearly 3 years ago and started doing web development 2 years ago.
            Since then I have branched out to other areas of technology including virtual machines, operating systems,
            and a little bit of crypto. In the future, I plan on branching out to cyber security, mainly on the software
            part of it, and app development mainly by learning <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a> and <a
                href="https://www.java.com/">Java</a>.</p>

        <p class="about-me about-me-right">The programming languages I know are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python,
            although I mostly only know how to apply my knowledge of them to web development. Frameworks I am familiar
            with are Twitter's <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> for CSS and <a
                href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> for Javascript. I mainly use <a
                href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> for my text editor, <a
                href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> for my wireframe designs, and <a
                href="https://github.com/">Github</a> and <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a> for my hosting.
            Sometimes when I am testing a new idea I will use <a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen</a>, or if the idea
            uses a framework or involves screen responsiveness I will use <a
                href="https://www.codeply.com/">Codeply</a>.</p>

        <p class="about-me about-me-center">My main operating system is <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>,
            although I am thinking of switching to <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch</a>, both of which are Linux
            distributions. I specifically run version <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-21-04-is-here">21.04
                (Hirsute Hippo)</a> of Ubuntu Desktop. I have some virtual machines using VirtualBox, which include
            Windows, Macs, and Linux operating systems. I have started attempting to use an Arch virtual machine
            recently to see if I would rather switch to Arch than keep using Ubuntu as my main operating system, or
            maybe a fork of Arch.</p>

        <p class="about-me about-me-right">The only cryptocurrency I mainly care about is Monero (XMR), although I keep
            up with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) just to be informed. I plan on adding a terminal mode to my
            website, it will mainly just be a design thing rather than a functionality thing, similar to the light and
            dark modes. I also plan to make the website more professional, especially with the terminology of the text
            contained on this website. In the near future, I plan on getting more involved in Web Development and
            operating systems.</p>
